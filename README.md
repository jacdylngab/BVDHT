# BVDHT: A Lightweight Distributed Hash Table

`BVDHT` is a Python-based distributed hash table (DHT) implementation designed to support dynamic peer membership, key-value storage, and basic peer-to-peer communication using a custom socket protocol. This project demonstrates key distributed systems concepts including consistent hashing and peer discovery.

## ðŸ§  Features

### âœ… Hash Table Operations

- Insert: Adds or updates a key-value pair.

- Get: Retrieves a value by key.

- Remove: Deletes a key (no-op if not found).

- Contains: Checks for existence of a key.


### âœ… DHT Protocols

- Locate: Determines the peer responsible for a given hash key.

- Connect: Joins a new peer into the DHT.

- Disconnect: Gracefully exits the DHT and transfers key ownership.

- UpdatePrev: Updates the prev reference on neighboring nodes.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/jacdylngab/BVDHT.git
```

### 2. Navigate into the Project Directory
```
cd BVDHT
```

### 3. Run the Program
ðŸŒ€ Starting a New DHT Ring
To start a brand-new DHT (i.e., the first peer):
```
python3 bvDHT.py
```
This initializes a fresh DHT network with the current peer as the only member.

ðŸ”— Joining an Existing DHT
To join an existing DHT network, provide the IP address and port number of an active peer:
```
python3 bvDHT.py <peer_ip_address> <peer_port>
```
Example:
```
python3 bvDHT.py 127.0.0.1 5000
```
